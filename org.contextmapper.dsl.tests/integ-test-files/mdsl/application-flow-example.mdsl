endpoint type SampleAggregate
// Your aggregate root does not specify any methods/operations. Therefore we can not generate any endpoint operations.


API provider SampleSystemProvider
	offers SampleApplication
	at endpoint location "http://localhost:8000"
		via protocol "tbd" // The protocol is generated if you specify the implementation technology in CML

flow SampleFlow type APPLICATION_FLOW
event FlowInitiated triggers command StartFlowCommand
command StartFlowCommand emits event Event1 + Event2
command Command1Command emits event Event1 o Event2
command Command2Command emits event Event1 x Event2
event Event1 triggers command Command1Command + Command2Command
event Event2 triggers command Command1Command o Command2Command
event Event2 triggers command Command1Command x Command2Command
event Command1Done + Command2Done triggers command JoinCommand
event Event1 + Event2 + FlowTerminated triggers command TerminateCommand + CleanupCommand
